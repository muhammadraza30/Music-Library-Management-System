# MusicLoud - Music Library Management System

## Project Overview
MusicLoud is a Java-based Music Library Management System designed to allow users to browse, search, and play songs. The system features two types of user authentication: **Admin** and **Simple User**, each with distinct functionalities.

## Features
### **Admin Features**
- Add, edit, or delete songs from the library.
- View all registered users.
- Delete user accounts.

### **Simple User Features**
- View the list of available songs, including details such as artist name, release year, and genre.
- Search for songs by title, artist, or genre.
- Receive song recommendations based on preferences.
- Play songs (with limited functionality).
- Create playlists (feature under development).

## Getting Started
### **Login System**
1. **Admin Login:** Use `admin` as both the username and password to access administrative functionalities.
2. **Simple User Login:** Enter your registered username and password. If you do not have an account, create one first.

### **Playing Songs**
- Songs must be added to the project folder in `.wav` format.
- Copy the file location of the song and paste it into the code at the **Play** button.
